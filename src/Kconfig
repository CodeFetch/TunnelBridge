	  TunnelBridge is an encrypted layer 2 tunnel which supports
	  multiple peers while working similar to a bridge.

	  It's safe to say Y or M here, as the driver is very lightweight and
	  is only in use when an administrator chooses to add an interface.

	help
	  This will write log messages for handshake and other events
	  that occur for a TunnelBridge interface. It will also perform some
	  extra validation checks and unit tests at various points. This is
	  only useful for debugging.

	  Say N here unless you know what you're doing.
